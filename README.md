## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

This time I decided to dig deeper in SASS and create a more complex structure for the styles files (even if it wasn't the case), but just for training purpose.

I got stuck because of a typoin my scss which was overwitting my styles (because } was closed too early) so I sholoud be more carefull next time.



### Continued development

Next time I want to try to create responsive deisign without media queries, to make it more fluid.
